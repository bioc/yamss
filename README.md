# yamss - Yet Another Mass Spec Software

# Refactoring

- Drop classes, diffrep from CMS (remove accessor functions)
- Consider diffreport functionality as we currently have it, mimicing xcms
- rename files() accessor function. Anything from BiocGenerics / ProtGenerics
- CamelCase: rawpeakinfo.
- Consider using getX for accessor functions
- CMS slots: camelcase bgsmooths, lenghen dens and densquants make similar to accessor functions.
- blobs? quants?
